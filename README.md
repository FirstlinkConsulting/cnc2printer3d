This Project is for the people who have their own desktop CNC machine and wish to use it as a 3D printer. Over the years We have had lots of good feedback about the subject and so decided to develop Hardware and Software solutions for makers. Using Mach3, due to it’s popularity as a CNC software, We have created ‘add-on’s for using it as a 3D printing software. We have also created this website to communicate with people interested in this topic.

We enjoy sharing theses ideas with you all and any contributions, comments and or feedback is invited.

Community, Collaboration and Sharing is our most important assets.
